# Castalia-WUSN

This is an extension of the Castalia framework for OMNeT++. The main difference to the original Castalia is that it is ported to OMNeT++ v5 and that it enables simulations of volumetric water content (VWC) and its correspoding undeground path loss model. Thus, complex simulations can be designed with changing VWC, which if taken into account in the underground path loss model and changes the transmission quality. 

More information about installation and running simulation scenarios are provided under docs/.

An example of its usage is provided in this technical report:
